- Background in machine learning in the 80's 
- PhD was in cochlear implants
- First prototype will put in museam
- gave up on convolutional networks in 90's 
- Active learning, first author David Cohn
	- Couldn't find job in academics
	- Worked on AdSense at Google, cohn-atlas algorithm

Class Webpage (Canvas)
- Signal Processing: Deep and Classical Methods
- Got in trouble from complaint, told to stop teaching DSP (in ~80/90s)
	- Got Fisheries department on his side to keep teaching
- A lot of folklore about FFT and ML
- FFT does not compute Discrete-time Fourier Transform
- Sieg Hall Sundays - south side door, knock on window if locked - office hours
- CNN seem to learn complex exponential eigenfunctions
	- No accident
- Homework due Tuesdays 8pm
- Two lecture note sets
	- One before, one "after" - including answers to discussion questions
- Midterm exam: 6-9pm April 30th
- Final exam: 6-9pm June 4th
- Deaf, bone growth
	- Several hearing aids
	- Speech hearing did not go up
	- Some theories, may have a related project later in the q

- Oversampling
	- Reduce costs
	- Most data is noise overreprents garbage
	- solved issues with ML for cough classification from 70-90% by downsampling
		- cell phone oversampling issues
- PHase response
	- when hearing is reduced, phase perception goes up (for some people)
	- phase correction due to multipath in mmwave increases datarate
- Loran C 
	- GPS before GPS
	- Transmitters along  coast
	- boat & plane location
	- Recievers had temperature controlled internal analog filter
		- $25k cost
		- same cost moved to optimal L-infinity approx for FIR filter
		- L-infinity norm (instead of L2 [squared error])
		- Building cost ~$1.2k - sold for same $25k cost
- Speed up convolution with FFT
	- Fast convolution
- Bernard Widrow

Goals
	- classical signal processing
	- motivate define some deep learning techniques
	- lot of folklore about DSP
		- FFT provides a DTFT (untrue)
			- DTFT is a mathematical operation with infinite output
			- sometimes big difference FFT gives DFT
		- Good to sample 2 times the bandwidth of a signal 
			- only if you want really expensive solution
		- FFT requires that the lenght of the transformed sequence be a power of 2
			- Not correct, size N is not any positive integer
			- Has to be a composite number N = N1 * N2 * ... * NK where
				all are integers
			- Cooley-Tukey algorithm
			- Talked to Tukey at work @ SRI international, first thing Tukey said
				above point

- Worked on Homma, Atlas, and Marks, "An Artificial Neural Network for Spatio-Tempeoral Bipolar Patterns: Application to Phoneme Classification" NIPS 1987
- Cohn, Atlas, Ladner "improving generalization with Active Learning" Machine Learning

- Why 44.1kHz sample rate
	- 2x 20kHz threshold for human hearing
	- not the actual reason
	- video recorders were used for first digital audio, systems were 60Hz NTSC or 50 Hz PAL system
	- in 60 Hz video there are 35 blanked lines, leaving 490 lines per frame or 245 lines per field, so the sampling rate is given by: 60 x 245 x 3 = 44.1kHz
	- became part of philllips/sony redbook standard
	- first consumer compact disc player was Sony CDP-101 40 years ago cost $1k
	- 96dB SNR
- Properties of discrete time systems
- Linearity
	- Superposition
		- T{aTx1[n] + bx2[n]} = ay1[n] + by2[n] where y1[n] = T{x1[n]}
	- Time invariance or shift invariance
		- shifting input produces output that is equivalently shifted
	- Causality
		- system does not respond until after the input starts
	- Bounded Input/Bounded Output (BIBO)
- Convolution most common LTI system
	- flip simpler of two functions
	- draw and make use of figures
